ðŸ§© mForm ETL Pipeline (Sample Nested JSON PoC)

This is a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) ETL pipeline for the mForm Sync Driver project under Dhwani RIS. It demonstrates how to extract nested survey data from a **local sample JSON file**, transform it into clean relational tables (master and child), and export the results to CSV.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Many NGOs using mForm, a MERN-stack survey tool, face challenges in converting deeply nested JSON form submissions into analytics-friendly formats. This ETL pipeline solves that problem by:

- Loading data from a **sample nested JSON file** (`sample_data.json`) that simulates mFormâ€™s survey submission format.
- Transforming the JSON:
  - Non-repeating fields â†’ `master_table.csv`
  - Repeating groups (e.g., household members, group questions) â†’ `child_table_<group>.csv`
- Exporting the transformed data into flat CSVs (ready for SQL or visualization).
- Supporting **incremental sync** using a `last_processed_id.txt` tracker.
