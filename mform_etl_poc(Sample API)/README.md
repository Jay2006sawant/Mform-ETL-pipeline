# ðŸ§© mForm ETL Pipeline (Sample API PoC)

This is a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) ETL pipeline for the **mForm Sync Driver** project under [Dhwani RIS](https://www.dhwaniris.in/). It demonstrates how to extract nested survey data from a **sample REST API**, transform it into clean relational tables (master and child), and export the results to CSV.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Many NGOs using **mForm**, a MERN-stack survey tool, face challenges in converting deeply nested JSON form submissions into analytics-friendly formats. This ETL pipeline solves that problem by:

- **Extracting** data from a Sample API that mimics mFormâ€™s nested JSON structure.
- **Transforming** the JSON:
  - Non-repeating fields â†’ `master_table.csv`
  - Repeating groups â†’ `child_table.csv`
- **Loading** the transformed data into flat CSVs (or later, to SQL databases).
- Supporting **incremental sync** using a `last_processed_id.txt` tracker.
